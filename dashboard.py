Thanks for clicking this. I wanted to build something that shows how I think and why I’m reaching out. So here I am.

I’m Preethi. I just finished my Master’s in Information Systems, and I learn best by building and solving open-ended problems.

I saw your post and looked through the open roles. I know I don’t meet the exact experience bar, but I still wanted to share this in case there’s room for someone who’s curious, adaptable, and ready to contribute.

I’m at a point in my career where every hour needs to teach me something or move something real forward. That’s why this opportunity in **Business Operations** stood out.

I don’t come from consulting or finance, but I’ve done real work, building forecasting models, prototyping tools, supporting ops teams, automating dashboards in retail. I won't pretend to know everything, but I’m curious, take feedback seriously, and I stay focused on moving things forward.

I’m looking for the kind of opportunity where learning happens through contribution, not just preparation. Even if that means starting small on a project or part-time basis. I’m comfortable starting wherever there’s a need and confident I’ll grow into more as I go.

Here’s what I know how to do and where I’m strongest:

- Make sense of messy data and connect it to real business decisions  
- Design quick, useful MVPs (dashboards, analyses, mini-tools)  
- Research user, product, and market behavior to uncover insights  
- Communicate clearly with non-technical stakeholders  
- Collaborate well. I thrive around smart, intense people  

I’ve done all of this in different contexts, but what I want now is to do it **alongside people who are building something I care about**.

If I got the chance to join you, I’d love to:

- Build internal tooling to help GTM or ops teams move faster  
- Design dashboards that bring structure to strategic decisions  
- Work on activation/onboarding or help build your customer success playbook  
- Run analysis on early-stage usage, product behavior, or team workflows  

I’m also open to things I’ve never done before. I don’t need to lead, I need the chance to learn and contribute in a serious way.

I’m not sending this out to a dozen companies. I made this because **I actually want to work with you** and because I think there’s room for someone like me on your team, even if it’s not a standard path.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. Even if it doesn’t lead to something right now, I’m rooting for what you’re building.
